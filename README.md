# Foundational Research Computing

This workshop aims to provide complete novices with foundational knowledge that will allow them to participate more efficiently in applied workshops teaching specific data analysis techniques such as e.g. next generation sequencing analysis, text mining, and others.

No prior exposure to computing terminology, infrastructure, or concepts is expected.

Participants have to bring their own laptops to participate effectively.

The workshop site was developed from the [Software Carpentry Lesson Template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-example).
